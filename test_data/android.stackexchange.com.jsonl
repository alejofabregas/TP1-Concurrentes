Obviously because exFat is Permission unaware file system. Did a regular mount and it will mount to /mnt/media/runtime/[Read &amp; Write &amp; Full &amp;  Default] with 3 separate 'mask' options mask==6 , 7 and 23 ( BTW that mask option isn't quite your umask . Its 'decimalized' umask -convert that 7 to binary to get real umask ). So in fact it invokes the same path as mentioned in the article behind the covers viz  /mnt/media/runtime/[Read &amp; Write &amp; Full &amp;  Default] \n\n{} I need to similarly mount  an ext4 partition with Titanium backup. Here are the issues.\nIf I mount  /storage/emulated/0/Titanium to ext4 /storage/[UUID]/Titanium  ( like I mentioned in fact it mounts to /mnt/media/runtime/[Read &amp; Write &amp; Full &amp;  Default] with 3 separate 'mask' options  underneath. With this mount. I can  Restore Apps but cant backup Apps. So R is allowed RW is not and I granted Titanium Root access. Maybe the explorer components of that apps are not using Root level access. \nSomewhere i read - mount using correct options of sdcardfs and 'fuse`. My question is precisely How ?\n\n\n{} I found somewhere a bindfs binary but it does not work with my  CPU Architecture \n\n{} Now with everything the same I Could RW using above approach in Android Pie . This is an issue with Android Q ...what changed ? how do I work around ?"], "tags": ["storage", "permissions", "mount", "partitions", "bind-mount"]}
